This is the README file for the GNU MongoINC-BACKUP for Fedora34 distribution. 
This script is used to get specific backs and return specific timeframes from received backs. 
Drop command is used. So it does not restore existing files again!
Fill in the variables in the config file under the /etc/mongobackup directory.
